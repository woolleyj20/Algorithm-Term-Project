# Creating Community Small Groups
A work by: Nathan Lee, Jason Woolley and Jason Djajasasmita

The problem that we are trying to tackle is one in which we have a group of people that attend the same church but do not know each other very well. In order for these members to really get to know each other, they wish to visit each other's houses for small group which occurs once a week. Couples at this church wish to stay in the same small group as their respective partner each week. The end goal of our program is for each of the members of the church to visit the houses of all other members within the minimum number of weeks possible. 

## Description
The goal of our project is to get experience using Java, the external Graph library, and gain experience analyzing the time complexity of our solution. Another purpose of this project is to gain experience finding and using greedy algorithms for complex problems. We used Java to program our algorithm and used JGrapht as our external graph library.

## Requirements
The only requirement to run the Jar file on the command line is to have Java 15.0.2 (most recent version) installed on your computer.

## User Manual
1. Clone the repsitory somewhere onto your computer
2. Open terminal and cd into community-groups-term-proj-jason-nathan folder then cd into the BibleStudyAlgorithm_jar folder (<b>NOT the BibleStudyAlgorithm folder</b>)
3. Once you are in the BibleStudyAlgorithm_jar folder, run the command: <b>java -jar BibleStudyAlgorithm.jar</b> <img width="656" alt="Screen Shot 2021-03-13 at 2 44 38 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43599897/111051806-a8b67000-840a-11eb-98c4-e9497dd10a33.png">
4. You are now able to run the program.
5. The program will ask for a text file name. Please choose between the three given text files: group1.txt (16 names), group2.txt (29 names) and group3.txt (34 names).
6. The output of the program will appear in the console and will be written to a textfile with the name of your choosing.

## Reflection
*Write the reflection about getting the small groups in the minimum number of iterations, etc.*

## Results
*Include screenshots of your program running, and the list of weekly groups for each of your three files.*
